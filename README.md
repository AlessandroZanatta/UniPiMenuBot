#Telegram Menu Bot for Pisa
This is an unofficial Telegram bot written in Python to download and send to subscribed users the weekly menu of the university restaurants here in Pisa.

You can start interacting with the bot by clicking [this link](https://t.me/UniPiMenuBot)!

## About
Basically, I'm lazy. Browsing the DSU website to get the weekly menu every single time I wanted to check it was way too boring.
So I created this bot, in the hope that others can find it useful!

Buon appetito!
